## Introduction and Objectives 
This basic recreation of the iconic arcade game Tetris was an assignment for an Algorithms and Programming course that I attended to during college. The main goal was to recreate all the game from scratch using Python3 and [Gamelib](https://github.com/dessaya/python-gamelib), a custom library/framework created by our teachers that has been built upon the [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) Canvas drawing API.

## Limitations
As this game is based on a very limited drawing library, there are a few limitations regarding the rescaling of the game, the use of sounds and more. You could see all of them in the official [Gamelib repository.](https://github.com/dessaya/python-gamelib)
